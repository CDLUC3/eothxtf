<description>The Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) is a defined contribution retirement savings plan for Federal employees. In this site, you can find answers to most questions about the TSP, check rates of return, get current information, download forms and publications, search for lost participants, and retrieve information about your TSP account. In the Account Access section you can obtain your account balance, request an interfund transfer, customize or replace your lost PIN, find out how much you are eligible to borrow, or check the status of your loan or withdrawal application. We also have calculators that project your future account balance or your monthly annuity payment.</description>
