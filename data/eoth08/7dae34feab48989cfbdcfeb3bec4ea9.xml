<description>The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights studies, analyzes, and reports on civil rights issues in the United States as well as implementation of civil rights laws and regulations in federal agencies. It has produced hundreds of publications on civil rights that are available to the public. In addition to its headquarters office in Washinton, DC, it has six regional offices that work with State Advisory Committees in every state in order to remain apprised of as well as play a constructive role in local civil rights issues throughout the nation. The Commission also provides discrimination complaint referral services to thousands of people every year who don&apos;t know where else to turn when they feel their civil rights have been violated.</description>
