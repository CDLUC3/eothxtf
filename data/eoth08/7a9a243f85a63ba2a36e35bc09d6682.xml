<description>The purpose of the Federal Court Clerks Association (FCCA) is to promote the professionalism and integrity of the federal judiciary. It is also the goal of the FCCA to increase the proficiency of court employees, to support the independence of the judiciary, and to foster cooperation between courts and the community. The Association serves as an intermediary between the clerks, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, the Federal Judicial Center, and the Judicial Conference of the United States Courts.</description>
