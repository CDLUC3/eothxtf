<description>The official Web site of the United States Commission for the Preservation of America&apos;s Heritage Abroad, a U.S. Government Agency. The Commission identifies cultural properties in Eastern and Central Europe associated with the heritage of U.S. citizens, including cemeteries, monuments, and historic buildings. It also negotiates agreements with the governments of the region on the preservation of the properties. A focus is placed on properties endangered by the genocide of cultural minorities in the region, such as the Holocaust&apos;s annihilation of its Jewish population.</description>
