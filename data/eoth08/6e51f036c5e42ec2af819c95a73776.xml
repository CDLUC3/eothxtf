<description>The Direct Consolidation Loans Web Site-this U.S. Department of Education web site provides information to borrowers, schools, and loan holders. Borrowers can apply online for consolidation of their federally insured student loan debt. The Higher Education Act (HEA) provides for a loan consolidation program under both the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Programs and the Direct Loan Program. Under these programs, a borrower&apos;s loans are paid off and a new consolidation loan is created. These programs simplify loan repayment by combining several types of Federal education loans (that may have different terms and repayment schedules or may have been made by different lenders) into one new loan.</description>
