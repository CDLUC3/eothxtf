<description>Welcome to the official website of the Government of the District of Columbia. With more than 150 online services, forms, and databases, the DC.Gov website makes it easy for residents, businesses, and visitors to perform tasks that formerly required a visit or phone call to a local office. As part of an electronic government initiative, this site establishes the platform to make the District government work better for its residents.</description>
