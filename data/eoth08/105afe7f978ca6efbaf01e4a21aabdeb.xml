<description>NIH will repay up to $35,000 in student loans each year when an M.D., Ph.D., or other postdoctoral scientist agrees to conduct qualified biomedical or behavioral research at any university, non-profit medical, or community-based organization for two years on at least a part-time basis. New and renewal online applications are accepted annually for five extramural loan repayment programs (LRP) funded by the National Institutes of Health.</description>
