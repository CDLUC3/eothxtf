<description>A goal of USDA Service Center modernization is to provide a Common Computing Environment (CCE) for Farm Service Agency, Rural Development, and Natural Resource Conservation Service personnel in Service Centers. The CCE will be built on a common Information Technology (IT) investment strategy, common telecommunications capability, common office automation tools, common administrative applications, and a common IT support organization. </description>
