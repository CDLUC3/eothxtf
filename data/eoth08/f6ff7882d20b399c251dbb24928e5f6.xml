<description>The Mission of the Department of the Interior is to protect and provide access to our Nation&apos;s natural and cultural heritage and honor our trust responsibilities to Indian Tribes and our commitments to island communities. Interior has established five Departmental goals that encompass the major responsibilities of the Department. These goals provide a framework for the strategic plans of Interior&apos;s bureaus. The Departmental goals are as follows: Resource Protection, Resource Use, Recreation,   Serving Communities, and Management Excellence.</description>
