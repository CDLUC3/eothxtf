<description>The FLETC serves as an interagency law enforcement training organization for more than 80 Federal agencies (aka Partner Organizations). The Center also provides services to state, local, and international law enforcement agencies. The Center is headquartered at Glynco, GA, near the port city of Brunswick, halfway between Savannah, GA, and Jacksonville, FL.  In addition to Glynco, the FLETC operates two other residential training sites in Artesia, NM, and Charleston, SC. The FLETC also operates an in-service re-qualification training facility in Cheltenham, MD, for use by agencies with large concentrations of personnel in the Washington, D.C., area.  The FLETC has oversight and program management responsibility for the International Law Enforcement Academy (ILEA) in Gaborone, Botswana; San Salvador, El Salvador; and Lima, Peru.  The FLETC also supports training at other ILEAs in Hungary and Thailand.  The Center&apos;s parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), supervises its administrative and financial activities. The FLETC Director serves under the authority of the Deputy Secretary. The Director is assisted with operational oversight and execution in the management of the Center by an executive team with unmatched breadth and depth of experience in training and administration. </description>
