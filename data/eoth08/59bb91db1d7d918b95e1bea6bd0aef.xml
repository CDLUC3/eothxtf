<description>The bipartisan National Prison Rape Elimination Commission (NPREC) was created by the Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 (PREA) and directed to develop national zero-tolerance standards for the prevention of and response to sexual violence in all confinement settings including lock-ups, small and large jails, state and federal prisons, juvenile facilities, immigration detention facilities, and community corrections facilities.  The Commission is performing a comprehensive legal and factual study of the penological, physical, mental, medical, social, and economic impacts of prison sexual assaults on federal, state, and local governments in the United States and on communities and social institutions generally.  Upon completion of its study, the Commission will report its findings and recommend national standards for enhancing the detection, prevention,reduction, and punishment of prison sexual assault.   Consistent with the stated intent of PREA, the Commission&apos;s recommendations will be designed to make the prevention of prison rape a top priority in every prison system in the United States; to establish a zero-tolerance standard for the incidence of prison sexual assault in America&apos;s lockups, jails, juvenile facilities, prisons, and detention facilities; and to protect the Eighth Amendment rights of federal, state andlocal prisoners.</description>
