<description>We are asking Federal employees to donate food for hungry families this summer. Food banks across the National Capital Region and around the country are facing severe shortages of non-perishable items, just as summer leaves more children without school nutrition programs. Federal employees nationwide are stepping up to meet this challenge by gathering 1,000,000 pounds of food for families in need this summer. We hope you'll join us!</description>
