<description>Located within the Department of the Interior, for over 30 years the National Business Center (NBC) has supported the Offices and Bureaus within the Department, as well as federal agencies outside the Department, as a Shared Service Center, providing world class business management systems and services.   We offer a diverse, yet integrated set of administrative solutions, and are currently the only federal agency designated by both OMB and OPM as a Center of Excellence in the financial management and human resources lines of business.  Our workforce of dedicated professionals with unsurpassed knowledge of federal business practices, along with our ability to leverage government and commercial best practices, allows us to service our customer base of more than 150 government agencies.</description>
