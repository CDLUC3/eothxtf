<description>The Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine (AFIRM) is a multi-institutional, interdisciplinary network working to develop advanced treatment options for our severely wounded servicemen and women. The AFIRM is designed to speed the delivery of regenerative medicine therapies to treat our most severely-injured servicemembers from around the world, but in particular those coming from our theaters of operation in Iraq and Afghanistan.ÃÂ  The AFIRM has five major research programs: Limb Repair and Salvage, Craniofacial Repair, Burn Repair, Scarless Wound Repair, Compartment Syndrom Repair.</description>
