<description>Brief Description
Club drugs tend to be used by teenagers and young adults at bars, nightclubs, concerts, and parties. Club drugs include GHB, RohypnolÂ®, ketamine, and others. MDMA (Ecstasy), Methamphetamine, and LSD (Acid), are considered club drugs and are covered in their individual drug summaries.


	Street Names
Special K, vitamin K, jet (ketamine); G, liquid ecstasy, soap (GHB); roofies (RohypnolÂ®).

	Effects
Club drugs have varying effects. Ketamine distorts perception and produces feelings of detachment from the environment and self, while GHB and rohypnol are sedating. GHB abuse can cause coma and seizures. High doses of ketamine can cause delirium and amnesia. RohypnolÂ® can incapacitate users and cause amnesia, and especially when mixed with alcohol, can be lethal.

	Statistics and Trends
The NIDA-funded 2010 Monitoring the Future Study showed that 0.5% of 8th graders, 0.6% of 10th graders, and 1.5% of 12th graders had abused RohypnolÂ®; 0.6% of 8th graders, 0.6% of 10th graders, and 1.4% of 12th graders had abused GHB; and 1.0% of 8th graders, 1.1% of 10th graders, and 1.6% of 12th graders had abused ketamine at least once in the year prior to their being surveyed.
