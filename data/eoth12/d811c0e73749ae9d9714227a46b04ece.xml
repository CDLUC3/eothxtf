<description>The President has said that the challenges America faces are unprecedented, and that we need to build a new foundation for economic growth in America. The Administration has begun this work with dramatic new investments in education, health care and clean energy, but we cannot do this alone here in Washington. Economic recovery is as much about what you're doing in your communities as what we're doing in Washington â and itâs going to take all of us, working together. Serve.gov is your online resource for not only finding volunteer opportunities in your community, but also creating your own. Use Serve.gov to help you do your part. Americaâs foundation will be built one community at a time â and it starts with you. Serve.gov is managed by the Corporation for National and Community Service.</description>
