<description>Throughout our nation, many schools are discovering the value of service-learning -- through projects that link education and service. At the forefront of this movement is Learn and Serve America, which helps support nearly one million students from kindergarten through college who are meeting community needs while improving their academic skills and learning the habits of good citizenship. In addition to providing Learn and Serve grants and scholarships for student service, the Corporation for National Service also promotes youth service through the National Service Leader Schools Program.</description>
