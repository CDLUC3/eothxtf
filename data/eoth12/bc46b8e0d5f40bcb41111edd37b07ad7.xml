<description>DoDEA is a field activity of the Office of the Secretary of Defense. It is headed by a director who oversees all agency functions from DoDEA headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. DoDEA's schools are divided into 3 areas: Department of Defense Schools - Europe (DoDDS-E), Department of Defense Schools - Pacific (DoDDS-P) / Domestic Dependent Elementary and Secondary Schools - Guam (DDESS-G), and the Domestic Dependent Elementary and Secondary Schools (DDESS). Each area is managed by an area director. Within each of these three areas, schools are organized into districts headed by superintendents.</description>
