<description>Seniors are one of America's most vital resources - offering a wealth of experience and energy. Through Senior Corps, nearly half a million Americans age fifty-five and older share their time and talents to help solve local problems as Foster Grandparents serving one-on-one with young people with special needs; Senior Companions helping other seniors live independently in their homes; and volunteers with the Retired and Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP) meeting a wide range of community needs.</description>
